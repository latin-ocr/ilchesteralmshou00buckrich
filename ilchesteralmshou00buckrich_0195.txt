their Trusteeship to the Bailiffs [and Burgesses] of Yevelches-
ter. Accordingly, at the expiration of Fifty years, the Transfer
was duly effected to the Bailiffs and Bmgesses, by Swanne's
Indenture dated February 12th in the sixteenth year of King
Edward the Fourth. 1477. The name
of Robert Veel. is discovered first in a Deed dated 1386.
Subsequenssy, in 1398, he figures as an attesting witness, and
Notary‚ Roberto Veel qui hoc scripsit—an addition that might
lead to the inference of his having been a Scrivener by occu-

a period of more than forty years—from 1386 to 1429- ap-

March 5 and 6, 1416, the affix “seniori” occurs after the

beyond question, namely, that Robert Veel either by his own

act and deed‚ or though the agency of his successor, was the
real and undoubted Benefactor to whom the Community of
Ilchester is indebted, for the munificent gift of their Alms-
house Charity. An impression of the Seal of Robert Veel is
attached to the Deed of Foundafion, and to most of the other
deeds of this date. The Symbol or Crest is a veritable Caff.
The Estate of the Ilchester Almshouse Charity consists of one

and valuable land; lying principally in the Parishes of Stock-
