East Window is pointed, has a narrow triple light, and three
cusped openings over the triplet. Though a handsome in-
terior window of its kind, there is yet observable a clumsy
solidity in the piers and mullions, betokening an early period
of transition from the severe to the more decorated style.
This window, which had been filled up in two different stages,
and then completely concealed inside by plaster, was reopened
a few years since. The first blocking up, of the lower half,
disclosed evidence of ruthless handling3 the side pillars having
been violently torn away, and broken up to help fill in the
cavity3 a memento, it may be, of the troublous era of the Com-
monwealth. The spring of the arch on either side, is decorated
at the extremity of the moulding with the head of a king and
3 Bishop, in a good state of preservation. The North and
South windows are later insertions3 and the oak wainscotting
lining the lower part of the walls, shows the date of 1673.
The Nave has at some former period, anterior probably to the
‘'Reformation, undergone extensive alteration. This is apparent
on a casual examination of the exterior walls. All the windows
have the appearance of being after insertions‚ to judge from
the vertical lines 111 the masonry. They are late perpendicular,
of a very common character. The small North Transept is of
the same late style, but contains some richly ornamented
Canopied niches. This interior, however, was either left in an
unfinished state, or the tracery must have been subjected here-
tofore to very extensive injury. The groined roof has entirely
disappeared ; or possibly, the work was never carried up above
the springs for the ribbed arches which still remain, It must
be confessed, that this mean looking (Camdenice very mean)
diminutive Church, refiects little credit on the old County
Town, in these days of universal Church restoration. But in
extenuation it may justly be pleaded, that the pecuniary

difficulties besetting the question of its rebuilding are of more
than ordinary magnitude.
