This road, running nearly East and West, joined Chep-
strete to West Strete. Directly opposite to the end of the
Lane, in VVest Street‚ stood the House of the Preaching Friars.
Hence doubtless, the later appellation of Abbey Lane given to
this cross street communicating with the Friary. 1424. One
Hugh de la Venele was an attesting witness to a Deed in the
time of Henry III: and two hundred years later, this street
continued to be known by the name of Venella.* Here, in the
reign of Henry VII. was a Corn Mill, built on a part of the
Garden or Orchard belonging to the Almshouse‚ on the East
Side of the House. Originally, the course of this Lane was
in a slanting direction, to the South of East, under the Garden
wall of the Manor House3 and then across the yard of the
present Rectory House, to its junction with the Yeovil Road
(chepstrete), opposite one of the inlets to Borough Green.
When the dwellings near the Green were removed some fifty
years since, and the waste ground was taken into the fields on
each side of the Limington Road, it became necessary to
change the course of Almshouse Lane by a curve to the left,
in order to make a convenient approach to the narrowed
entrance of the Road to Limington.

4 LA LANE, Back Lane. In an undated Deed; temp.
Hen, 111„ this by-way is called La Lane3 and is afterwards
mentioned, 1349, as “the road leading towards the New Mill.”
The entrance to Back Lane is facing the North East corner of
the Market Place. At its further end, the Lane branches off
right and left: the turn to the left leads to the River, and to
the field path towards Limington and Yeovilton. This same
turning led formerly to the New Mill; which was just outside
the Town Wall, in the Kingsham field. The New Mill was in
existence when Dr. Stukeley published his Itinerary in 1723,
but was destroyed in the early part of the present century. In
Stukeley’s Plan of Ischalis, the New Mill Stream is shewn
