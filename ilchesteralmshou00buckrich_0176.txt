junction with Chepstrete‚ near the Market Cmss, continues
its course south West in the direction of Ilminster and
Exeter. The West Gate of the Town was the boundary of
the Street in that direction. From the undeviating straight-
ness of the Fosseway until it touched the Wall, the position os
this Gate might be distinctly seen from the North Gate at the
Bridge ε and thus, the eye could take in at a single glauce, a
view of the Street throughout. In early times, the ancient
Prison, or Common GaoL stood near the Market Place‚ but
withdrawn from the road; and was approached by the County

presenting a handsome frontage towards the Street. From
the Friary Northwards‚ the houses, built in mocks, or detached‚
disclosed glimpses at intervals of the Town Wall behind. While,
near the Market Plane, where the population congregated
more closely, the dwellings doubled back from the street3 to
which they had access by an outlet or lane, opening opposite

known, until its final disappearance some fifty years ago,
when the Street was remodelled after its present homely
fashion. At the end of Shirepath, under the Town Wall
Westward‚ ran another lane, leading to a place called The
Yard, and hence deriving itsname of Yard Lane. The exact
