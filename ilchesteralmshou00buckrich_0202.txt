4. Robert Veel. The following particulars relating to

Robert Veel and his Family, are to be found in Hutchins’s
History of Dorset3 and were communicated to me by a friend.
Robert Veel, or Veale, is styled “of Mapoudre.'' Of his origin
and descent nothing is stated; but in the 40th Edw. III. 1367,
John Russell of Mapoudre and Agnes his wife, gave by
Charter to Robert Veel and his heirs, certain lands in Mapou-
dre and Meleombe. By a deed of the 6th of Henry IV. the
land seems to have consisted of about 100 aeres. In the 15th
of Henry VI, one of the Family conveyed these lands to John
Coker of Mapowder and his heirs. Robert Veel married
Alice Muskett, of Frome Whitfield (See No. 81. 1396.) This
Alice Muskett‚ was the only issue of the second marriage of
her mother Joan, daughter and heir of Ralph and Joan Basset.
By the first marriage, the said Joan had four ohildren whose
surname was Sexpenn. Henry and Nicholas Sexpenn died
without issue, leaving their sisters Joan and Enimota their
heirs. Emmota released all her right in the Frome Whitfield
property to her half sister Alice Veel, in 1420. Joan Sexpenn
married John Comeland. [His name appears as a witness,

No. 86 l402]. By Alice Muskett, Robert Veel had one

child and hei1·ess‚* Alianor or Eleanor. In a Roll of Court

⁸ 1f this statement implies that Robert veel at no time had more than this one child,
it is of course conclusive against my supposition (Sec. lx.) that he might have had a son
Robert, from whom he was distinguished by the addition of Senior to his name. The
Founder of the Almshouse must have lived to a good old aga-for we gather from the above
extu-acts, that he acquired land in 1367 ; and (lating from this event to the probable time of
his death in 1430, the long period of 63 years intervenod.
