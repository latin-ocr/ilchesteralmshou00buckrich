levelled by the gardener‚who shewed me the track of it and
had by times in digging, taken up remainders of the wall with
many coins, bricks, tiles, and other antiquitieS. I bought some
coins of him ; among which, the brass one of Antoninus Pius
depicted in the Plate3 on the Reverse, Britannia sitting on a
Rock with a military ensign. Sir Philip Sydenham has a
great quantity of coins, found here3 and the Minister of the
Parish gave many to the learned Mr. Coke of Norfolk.
This gardener showed me many square paving bricks in the
floor of his house, and told me he dug up a great brass coin as
big as half a crown under the foundation of the wall, which
doubtless would have discovered to us the era of it's building.
Crossing the Sherborne and Limington road, we find the ditch
again, turning up to the River side on the Eastern angle, con-
formable to the scheme3 where it is again enclosed into
gardens and pastures. The occupier of the gardens there,
informed me too, that he had frequently dug up the like an-
tiquities together with the foundations of the wall. The
quickset hedge that fences in the garden, stands on the edge
of the ditch, and observes its turn at that angle of the city.
By the New Mill, it meets the River. In all the gardens
hereabouts by the Borough Green, they find foundations of old
houses, and some run across the present streets now visible
above ground. This ditch, when perfect, admitted the water
of the River quite round. Mr Lockyer’s house is built upon
Subterraneous Arches, They say, here have been Sixteen
Parish Churches, and foundations are to be found all the town
over3 and that the suburbs extended southward, esPecially on
the Yeovil Road, which formerly had a Gate, It is not to be
doubted, but that there were Grates at the passage of all the
other streets. They say, the Bishop of Bath & Wells has a
manuscript relating to the ancient State of this town. They
have the same tradition as in many other places, that the old

city was seton fire by matches ty’d to the tayls of sparrovm,
