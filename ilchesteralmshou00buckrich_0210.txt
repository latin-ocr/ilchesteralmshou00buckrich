let fly from a place call’d Standard Cross Hill. As soon as I
came to the Inn, the Swan, Ι saw a great parcel of the little
stones of a tesselated pavement, found but two days before, in
a garden over the way near the River. A crowd of people
came immediately, out of curiosity to see it, and tore it up. Ι
saw some of the remainder in situ, about two foot deep, laid in
strong mortar upon a hard gravell’d floor. Ι made the Owner
melancholy, with informing him, what profit he might have
got by preserving it to shew to strangerS. The Foss way re-
tains it's name, and makes the principal Street: the pavement
thereos, or the original Ford across the River‚ may be seen on
the West side of the Bridge, made with great flag stoneS.
Upon the Bridge is an old Chapel, called Little St Mary’s.
At the foot of the Bridge, within the town, is another called
White Chapel, both converted into dwellings. Foundations of
houses, chimney pieces, and the like, have been dug up in the
meads on the West side of the town, and on both sides the
River, with stone coffins and funeral apparatus. The Head of
the Mayor’s Stafff* or Mace, is a piece of great antiquity in
cast brass. There are four Niches with four images, two
Kings, a Queen, and an Angel. It seems to have been the
Crozier of some Religious House. Round the bottom is wrote,
in two lines, † JESU DEDRUERIE.

† NEME DUNETMIE. In the Northern angle,
beyond the old ditch of the city, towards the River, have been
some bastions and modern fortifications of the time of King
Charles the First. Beyond the River is a Village adjoyning,
call’d Northover, with a Chureh. They talk of a Castle stand-
ing where now is the Gaol, and that the tide came formerly
up hither, tho· now it reaches not beyond Langport. These

were all the remarkables I met with at Ischalis, where Ι

²¹¹ This Mace is still in existence, and is used at the annual mention of the
Bailiff. It was exhibited at Kensington, among other Corporation Maces, in
1863. The Inscription is in Lombardic letters, and has ‚never been satisfactorily
construed.
