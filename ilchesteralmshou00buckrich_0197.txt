assigning the reasons of their lapse. The Corporation as now
constituted, is composed of a Bailiff and twelve Capital Bur-

gesses. Under previous Charters the Burgesses had been

of the Almshouse‚ are preserved in some Deeds of that time.
BAILIFFS OF YEVELCHESTER.

1427. James Attevvelle and Richard Trubelas.

1428. John Chepman and John Glainville.

1429. Richard Purye and Thomas Seymour.

1477. Robert Aughte and Walter Wale.
The last named, were the Bailiffs to whom Richard Swanne
Canon of Wells, and his Co-Trustees, transferred the manage-
ment of the Almshouse property. An Indenture of the
time of Henry the Eight‚ 1538, opens with this enumeration
of Civie Dignitaries —-‘ ‘To all Christs’ Faithful . . .
John Cuffe, Constable of the Town of Yevelohes ter, and
Superintendent of all the lands ancl tenements belonging to
the Almshouse in Yevelohester aforesaid3 and Thomas Haw·
kere Head Stevvard of the same House; also William Ray·
monde Bailiff of the said House; and the whole Community
of the same Town . . . . wish health in the Lord‚ ever-
lasting.'’ Time has laid a heavy hand on the honours and
privileges of this Venerable Body. The Reform Bill‚ at one
fell blow reduced it to politioal nonentity3 and the Corpora
tion of Ilohester may now be said to be kept alive, solely by its
relations with the noble bequest of Robert Veel.
In the year 1858, a material change was effeeted in the Trus-
teeship of the Ilehester Almshouse Charity. Under the
auspices of Her Majesty’s Attorney General‚ Nine additional
Trustees, not being members of the Corporation‚ were nomi-
nated to aet with the Bailiff and. Burgesses. Together they
constitute a Board of Trustees. The Bailiff, in virtue of his
office, is Chairman,vvhen present, at all meetings of the Board.
