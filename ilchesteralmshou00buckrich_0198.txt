are regulated in accordanee with a Scheme propounded by the
Master of the Rolls.

The Bailiffs and Burgesses of Ilehester, were the sole Trustees
of this fine eharity for the lengthened period of 381 years;
from the 12ῐ11 of February 1477, to the 5ῐῙΙ of August 1858.

than a modern look-up; and quite inadequate to the require-
ments of the County prison. Camden evidently did not
understand that the “little stone house” at the right, was
intended by Leland as the Gaol ,· for he says—‘⁶ Near it
(Whitehall) was a house of lepers. If this be not Leland's
