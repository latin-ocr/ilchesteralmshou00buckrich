XVI. IschaliS, lvelchester: And the Foss Way.

From I)r Stukeley’ Itinerarz'um Curiosum Ed. 1723.

This Station of the Romans is scituate on the South side of
the River Ivel or Yeovil, the Velox of Ravennas. Pillbridg a
little lower seems to retain the name. It is the Uzella of
Ptolomy. I perceiv'd immediately that this place had been
originally encompass’d with a wall and ditch, and traced out
the manifest vestigia thereof quite round. It was an oblong
square 300 paces in length, 200 in breadth, standing upon the
oblique points of the compass‚ conform to the Foss way, which
passes through the town exactly from North East to South
West. The NE. side of the city lay against the River, where
I saw foundations of the wall here and there, and took up
several Roman bricks in searching for it in the gardens, The
ditch on the N.W. side is become a road called Yard Lanefi‘*
as going behind the yards and gardens. Then it runs thro. the
Friary Garden, (for the Religious had extended their bounds
beyond the city,) and turned the road on the outside. Then
it goes along the road† on the back of Mr Lockyer’s garden.
It is now visible between the Yeovil Road and the Southern

angle ι then runs thro another garden, being for the most part

⁵¹* Here Dr. Stukeley has fallen into an error3 probably never having heard
of The Yerde so frequently mentioned in the Deeds, the Site of which must
have been somewhere in the vicinity of this Lane.

† This road could only have been a temporary ffioroughfare, since it has
long dis-appeared in the Paddock of the Farm House. The charmel of the Moat
being unclaimed property, was at first used by the Public as a shorter means of
communiefflon, in those parts os it conveniently situated for the purpose.
