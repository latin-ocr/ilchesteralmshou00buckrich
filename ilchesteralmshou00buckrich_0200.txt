XIII. ΑΝΟῙΕΝΤ mammas. HERWARD.

This name, whichgives out a genuine Saxon ring, fre-
quently occurs in the oldest of the Deeds; and first, in that
supposed to be eoeval with the reign of King John. The
Herwards were a Family of considerable note in Iveleester‚ in
a Century (the 13th) when Iveleester itself was the most im-
portant Town in the County. Sucoeeding generations of them
became owners also of Estatos iu the adjacent Parishes of
Lymyngton and Yevelton. The name appears often and
prominently, in the earliest MSS. but at longer intervals in
the 14th century. It disappears altogether after 1402. This
Family can be traced in direct lineal suecession from King
John to Edward III.
