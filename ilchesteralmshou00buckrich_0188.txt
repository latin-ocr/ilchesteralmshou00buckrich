fifty years after Leland‚ “†leere was not less than six Clzurclzes
in this town. The present Parish Church is very mean, but
has an Octagon Tower and a North Chapel.'’

That there were Five Churches in Ivelcester during some part
of the Middle Ages‚ may be proved satisfactorily from docu-
ments in the Muniment office at W ells. They will demon-
strate this fact3 that the Dues of Five Churches or Parishes
are, even at the present time, chargeable in the shape of Pro·
curations and Paschals upon the Rector of Ilchester. These
five Churches are thus designated. 1. St Mary Maj0r. 2.
St Mary Minor. 3. St Michael. 4. St John. 5. St Peter.

1. St. Mary Major: Now the sole remaining, and the
Parish Church. This appears to have been the case, as far
back as the reign of Henry the Eight. The present Church
was the only one “occupied’' when Leland visited Ilchester3
the others were in ruins. This Church is cited in two Deeds,
dated 1402. 1403, as “the Church of the blessed St Mary
Maj0r.’' It is a small building of rather mean and dilapidated
appearance. Indeed Camden, as we have just seen, denounced
it as “very mean” nearly three hundred years ago : Perhaps
he dealt uncharitably with the venerable Mother Chureh. Yet
portions of it are of great Antiquity. The Tower is early
English, and its date may certainly be carried back six
hundred years, or more.. It is an Octagon of solid pro-
portions, supported by massive buttresses; devoid of ornament
throughout3 and in it’s upper compartment pierced with
simple lancet openings to admit light to the staircase and
Belfry. But in the year 1611, it’s South Side was grievously
mutilated and disfigured, in order to provide a Staircase to a
Gallery, then first erected in the Church. The Chancel
is of early date, though less ancient than the Tower. The

†The words in Italics are not found in the Edition of 1789; but Camden
there alludes to four and to two Churches, leading his readers to infer that
there were Six.
