by grant of Robert veel, under certain conditions (No. 121)

. And Ι, Robert Grey, will guarantee* the same
Manor, lande, and tenements, to Richard Swanne, δια, ayainst
Jolm Abbot of Glastonbury and his Successors for ever. And

⁸* This Guarantee, which carries a touch of sarcasm with it, supplies another incidental
proof of the arbitary authority claimed, and where possible enei-ted, by the Min-ed Heads of
the Great Abbey over their weaker Brethren, the Abbots of Muchelney, the Priore of
Montaeute, and the Superiora of other smaller Religious Communities that lay within the
grasp of their power. The undertaking of Robert Grey, the Grantor, which seems to imply
no great compliment to Abbot John and his successore, was no doubt a necessary precantium
since certain sums of money accumulated out of the property here transferred. had been
placed sor ease custody (No. 121) in the Abbey of Muchelney, and in Moutacute Priory3 in
compliance with n special Proviso of the Deed of Foundation.
