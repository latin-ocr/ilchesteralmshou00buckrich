2. St Mary Minor. Opposite the Whitehan,
in Chepstrete, and not far removed from the River, stood
the Church of St Mary the Less. D‘ Stukeley has certainly
misapprehended the position of this edifice3 which he calls
Little St Mary’s Chapel ; and places (in his plan) on a
small promontory thrown up by the action of the stream
at the centre of the Bridge‚ on the East side: deeming it
probably to have been a Way-side Chapel‚ similar in character
to the beautiful Chantry on Wakefield Bridge. But the
true site of this Church is very accurately determined in two
of the Almshouse Deeds. It is “in Chepstrete”; “opposite
to a certain tenement which adjoins the House of the
Prioress of White Hall.’' 1346. And further, the same
burgage is represented, in 1370, to be “in the public street of
Yevelchester, over against the Church of the Blessed Mary,
adjoining the burgage of Mary the Prioress of Nywehalle’'.
We might now look for the site of St Mary Minor on the
Lawn of Mr Harris’s gai-den, somewhere between that gentle!
man's house and the River. A very fine Yew formerly grew
near the spot, which from its large dimensions‚ might be sup-
posed to represent the growth of several centuries3 though
bearing no outward impress of extreme antiquity. It is not a

fanciful surmise, that this fine Yew tree may once have over-
shadowed the walls of Little St Mary’s Church.

3. St Michael. St Michael’s Church is not alluded
to in the Almshouse MSS. But Leland, in his quaint
manner, gives this curicus description of the sacred edifice.
The greatest token of auncient building that I saw yn al the
toune ys a stone gate archid and voltid‚ and a chapelle or
Chirch of St Michael over it.” If this is a true account of
St Michael's Church at Ilchester, it was what is technically
known as a Hanging Chape13 similar to the specimen which is
still in existence at Langport: though in the latter instance,
the Chapel was long ago diverted from its original purpose,
