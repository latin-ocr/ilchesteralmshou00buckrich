the water at the old Ford. The Ford, and this roadway to it,
were in use until the Bridge which now spans the Ivel took
the place, in 1809, of one narrow and inconvenient‚ and
perhaps of no great antiquity. Leland‚ about 1540, thus des-
cribes the bridge, as he found it. “I enterid by South west,
(Le. towards the South West) into Ilchester‚ over a great stone
bridge of seven arches, now one of two, yn the midle wherof
were two little houses of stone, one of the right hand, wher
the commune gaiol is for prisoners’ yn Somersetshir. The other
house is on the left hand. The lesser of booth seemed to me
to have beene a chapelle. The toune of Ilchester hath beene a
very large thyng, and one of the auncientest tounes yn al that
quarter. At this tyme it is in wonderful decay, as a thing in
a manner rasid with men of warre.’' Camden (1586) remarks
upon this statement——“Leland’s free Chapel by the Bridge, on
the opposite side of the River, is still known by the name of
Whitehall‚ now a weaving shop, anciently a hospital, and then
a nunnery‚ and at last a Free Chapel. Near it wasahouse
of lepers. If this be not Leland's house on the right hand of
the Bridge, that is quite gone3 but his Chapel on the left hand
is still a dwelling house.” There is some confusion in these
descriptions, which it is not easy to reconcile. If Leland's
account is to be taken literally3 it would mean, that of the
two little stone houses in the midle of the Bridge, the one on
his right hand as he crossed into the town, was the Gaol, and
the other on his left was the Chapel. But Camden’s comment
on this description rather perplexes than elucidates the mean-
ing3 for he seems to identify the right hand house on the
Bridge, with Whitehall which, though close to the river,
had no connexion with the Bridge, In Stukeley’s map, the
disused Chapel is placed near the water, below the Bridge, not
upon it. These particulars are further alluded to elsewhere.

(Hen ΙΙΙ.) occurs the name of “J ohannes Albe de Ivelcestra.”
