INTRODUCTION.

 

In the Autumn of 1858, several Paekets of old Deeds‚
relating to the Property of the Almshouse at Ile-hester, were
restored by the Representative of the late Lord H untingtower‚
(formerly Sir William Manners) to the eustody of the newly
constituted Board of Trustees of the Ilehester Almshouse

Charity. ²*

These Manuseripts follow in regular successim, from the
time of King John and Henry ΙΙΙ., through the reigns of
Edw. I, Edw. II, and Edw. III, Richard the Second,
Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI, Edward IV, Hen.
VII, Hen. VIII, Queen Elizabeth and James the First„

In some of them, the Regna] Date is wanting ; and these
undated Deeds are, most of them, anterior to the] reign of
Edward the First. One may probably be assigned to the
time of King John,'or to a period certainly not later than the
commeneement of Henry the Third’s reign. The earliest re—
corded date is the seventh year of Edward I. Feb. 3rd‚ 1279.

They are written for the most part, in the usual con-
traeted Latin ; and some of the oldest of the manuscripts are
very fine specimens of Calligraphy. A feW‚ of the time of the
Third Edward, are in Nox-man French3 and two or three,
belonging to the latter part of the 15th and the beginning of
the 161h centuries‚ are in the quaint old English of the Period.

From the Reign of Henry VIII, the Deeds are few in

number, of less comparative interest, and chiefly in the

vernacular tongue.
Ψ These Oeeds are in the keeping of the Clerk to the Boura.
