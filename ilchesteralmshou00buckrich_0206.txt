But no portion of these inequalities appearqto mark the course
of the Town Wall. The works‚ whatever may have been their
nature and intention, extend outside the old boundary, and fill
up the centre of this large close of pasture. A long bank or
ayqerg stretching East and West straight across the field, with
a deep fosse3 and flanked midway on the North side towards
the River, by a circular mound and ditch—these are the chief

features of the earth works in this quarter. There are also
some remains of field fortifications nearer to the site of the

Town Wall, and in the direction of the River3 which are per-
haps the fortifications pointed out by Stukeley, as having been
thrown up by the army of King Chai-les the First.

It is to be regretted‚ that so keen and in-

telligent an antiquary as D‘ Stukeley‚ should have neglected
his opportunity of throwing a clearer light on the obscure his-
tory of ancient and medioeval Ilchester. For it is almost certain,
that one hundred and fifty years ago, “ the remarkables ’' of the
place, which he dismissed so hastily in his brief visit, with a
mere cursory glauce, or neglected to observe at all, could
neither have been feW, nor quite unworthy of a more accurate
research.
XV, mscmmnm. THE COMMUNION PLATE belonging to
Ilchester Church, consists of a Chalice and two Patens‚ of sil-
ver. The Cup is of handsome shape. Its exterior is chased,
around the upper and lower parts of its circumference, with
leaf and scroll work enclosed within double bands or lines,
divided by decorated bends into four equal eompartments. A
similar kind of ornament, without any division, is repeated
round the under surface of the older Paten‚ which when
reversed, fits on as a cover to the top of the Cup. On the stem
of the Paten‚ which is the handle of the cover, appears in bold
figures the date 1574, with the letters E C beneath. The
other Paten is larger, and unornamented. An inscription on
the rim proclaims it “ The guifte of Anne Summers 1628.”
