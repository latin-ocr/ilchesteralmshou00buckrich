Religious Houses: the building was dismantled‚ and partially
ruined, and the ground on which it stood was sold. “ On the
fourth day of J uly 1545, the King granted to William Hodgys
of Myddelchynnock in the Co. of Somerset, and to William
Hodgys of London, son of the former, and their heirs, for the
sum of 1:695. Ο. 5d. the site of the Monastery of the Grey Friars

VI. THE cHURCHEs on IvELoEs'rER. There is a prevailing
notion, that the town of Ivelcester was anciently crowded
with a fabulous number of Churches. And even Collinson‚
adopting the previous “they say '¹ of Stukeley, refers to the
number sixteen as a not improbable quota. But no evidence
whatever is produced in support of this exaggerated com-
putation. If numerous Churches had been in reality erected
and endowed there, and even afterwards demolishal, some
kind of record of the fact beyond mere tradition, must have
survived their demolition. The names at least, would turn up
in Ecclesiastical Terriers. Leland, in 1540, states—“ there
hath bene in hominum memoria four Paroche Chirchis yn the
toune, whereof one yet is occupied. Tokens of the other two
yet stond; and the fourth is elene yn ruine.'’ He further says,
“There is a fre *chapelle in the toune, the baksyde whereof
cummith to the ryver syde, even hard bynethe the bridge, and
ther joynith a right praty mansion house to this chapelle. I
have hard that many yeres syns ther was a Nunry wher
this chappelle is.” Hence perhaps, D¹ Stukeley derived the
name of Whitechapel, which he gave to the building standing

there in his time. ⁴ Camden writes, some

into a Free Chapel after the Dissolution of that Foundation. I think too, that
Camden must have reckoned this as one of his Six Churches.
