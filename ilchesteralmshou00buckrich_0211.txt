stayed but half a day, Hence I continued my journey [to-
wards Ham Hill] along the Foss, which I observed paved

with the original work in many parts. It is composed of the
flat quarry stones of the country, of good breadth, laid edge·
wise, and so close that it looks like the side of a wa-ll fallen
down, and thro. the current of so many ages is not worn thro-3
a glorious and useful piece of industry, and to our shame not
imitated, for a small reparation from time to time, would have
preserved it entire, and where it is so much wanted in a dirty
country ..... Here [on St Michael's Hill, Montacute]
has been a Castle and Chapel at top, and below it a Religious
House, built by the Earl of Moriton, in the time of William
the Conqueror. Another Hill is near it, much of the same
figure. Between them and the Foss, upon the same hilly
ridge, is a Roman Camp called Hamden Hill, with a double
ditch, to which leads a vicinal Roman way from the Foss thro.
Stoke. The Fossis very plain and strait hither, and to Pether-
ton Bridge near South Petherton, once the Palace of King
Ina ...... Beyond this the Foss grows intricate and
obscure, from the many collateral roads made thro. the bad-
ness and want of reparation of the true one. Yet it seems to
run thro. Donington, which stands on a very high hill. . ,

. Ι suppose this Foss went on the East side of Chard.
and so by Axminster and Colyton to Seaton‚ or Moridunu1n; ·
where properly it begins. VVhence, if we measure its noble
length to the Sea coast in Lincolnshire, at Grimsby or Salt
fleet, where I imagine, it ends; it amounts to 250 Roman
Miles, in a strait line from North East to South West.
