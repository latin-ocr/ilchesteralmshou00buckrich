The Documents thus unexpectedly brought to light, by
their restoration to the right owners, refer to Lands and
Tenements situate in the Pal-ishes of Stoeklinch Magdalen,
Stoeklineh Ottersay‚ Montacute, Chilthorne Domer, the
blanor of Sock Dennis, Ilehester, Northover, Limington,
Somerton Erleigh and the Parish of Somerton3 and a large
proportion of the lands therein dealt with, including the
RIanor of Stocklineh, constitutes the Property of the Ilchester
Almshouse Charity at the present time.

The most important of these Manuseripts‚ in relation to
the Charsty, are the two which bear date, respecfflvely, on
March 12, 1426, in the fourth year of Henry VI, and on Feb.
12, 1477, in the sixteenth year of Edward IV.

The former is the DEED OF FO UNDATION‚executed
by RO BERT VEEL; Wherein he provides, that subsequently
to the fulfilment of certain speeified obligations, the Trustee-
ship of the Almshouse‚ and of the Charity Lands, should be
vested in the Bailiffs and Burgesses of Ilehester and their
Successors, for ever. The other Deed, is the Indenture made
by Swanne, a Canon of Welis, and others, to the Bailiffs and
Burgesses; by which the intention and will of the Founder in

this respect, were fully carried out.

These TRANSCRIPTS are arranged in Chronological oderr ;
the conti-actions of the original text are for the most part
omitted, and the abbreviated syllables are given in extenso.
After each Transeript, is added an abstract of its oontents, in
English. The Appen-dix contains some brief notiees of
Mediaeval Ile-hester, arranged under separate heads, and
elucidated by a Plau of the Town, on the basis of Dr.

Stukeley's IseHALffi.
