House is now the solitary occupant of a locality once closely
built over, and teeming with population.

II. THE WALL ΛΝΒ GATEs.

Traces of the greater portion of the course of the Wall
are still discernible. Stukeley’s Plan represents the place as
enclosed within an oblong fence or Wall, of regular pro-
portions3 and the Author states, that he “traced out the
manifest vestigia thereof quite round.’' Whatever may have
been the exact shape or figure of the enceinte, there can be no
question that when the Civil Wars broke out, Ilchester was a
walled and regulated fortified town. Like Bfidgwater, Lang-

garrisoned by Royalist troops, But one after another in quick
succession, the Western fortresses fell into the hands of the
Parliamentary Generals3 and in their turn the Walls and
Fortifications of Ilchester, after a stubborn defenee, were
stormed and captured by the gallant Blake.

The line of the Wall may yet be trackecl across the pastui-e
lands at the South and East of the Town. A remnant of the
Wall itself is said to have been standing fifty years ago, in the
garden of a house, now the King William Inn, within the
recollection of the present owner. Just where the Inn joins
on to the next house beyond, West Street <thus far quite
straight) makes a bend to the right, towards the Mead. At the
point where this bend occurs, the street was formerly spanned
by the West Gate. From thence, the line of the Wall followed a
South easterly direction, through the Manor-Farm Barton‚ and
Waggon House, across the Paddock and the lower end of the
Rectory Garden3 emerging at length into the Yeovil Road, near
the site of the present Turnpike House. Here, the South Gate
guarded the entrance to the Town ; and the Wall continued
its South-easterly route though the Orchard, along the left

bank of the brock, up to the spot where the latter abruptly
