V. 'mn nnuma In West strete, facing the Almshouse, was
the East Gate of entrance to the House of the Franciscan or
Gray Friars, otherwise called the Preaching Friars3 and over
against the end of the Lane which bounds the Almshouse on
the South, stood the Friary itself. There is an accurate des-
cription of this locality given in the Deed of Foundation‚ and
in some others, which mark out with precision the Almshouse
premises. Stukeley was correct in his remark, that ‘⁶ the re-
ligious (meaning the Friars) had extended their bounds beyond
the city”; for no doubt, the precincts of the Friary comprised
that angle of ground beyond the Wall, shut in between Pill
Bridge Lane and the high Road. Two quotations will suffice
to determine the precise position of the Friary. In 1424, one
John Abbot grants to Alexander de la Lynde and others, “ a
piece of ground in Yevelehester, situate at the end of Venella,
otherwise Abbey Lane, just opposite the House of the
Preaching Friars of the same place.'' Again, the position of

House to which it was the Portal, were consequently near to
each other, and both within the Walls of the Town: though
Dr Stukeley’s Plan also exhibits some extra mural buildings
in connexion with this Monastic Foundation. There are now
no vestiges of The Friary existing above ground. But prior to
the Reformation, it was no doubt a fine and striking pile of
building. camden leads us to infer as much when, alluding
to this Monastery, he says—‘⁴ the remains of the Priory
Church‚ whose North Transept is used for spinning silk, shew
it to have been magnificent. It belonged to a House of Friers
Preachers, or Grey Friers, founded before the Eleventh of
Edward the First.” Leland’s allusion to the Friary is very
brief—“Ther was also a late a House of Freres yn this toune.''
At the Dissolution, the Friary shared the common sate of other
