deviates from its straight course. Then‚ leaving the stream, the
track runs obliquely across the Orchard, North East, to the
Limington Road, where the East Gate commanded the ap-
proach to the Town. From this Gate the Wall resumed its North
easterly course for a short distance in the Kingsham field;
then turned to the North West, and pursued that route through
the same field, until it touched the River. Thus far, the
line of the enclosure may even nOW‚ be more or less distinctly
traced‚ by the peculiar configuration of the ground. Along
the whole extent of track just described, the land slopes gently
down towards the old moat of the fortifications 3 the site of the
town being slightly raised above the level of the surrounding
fields: but this formation of the ground is less paeceptible on
the Western side. On touching the River, the Wall was carried
along the left bank‚¹'“ to the Bridge and the North Gate. Be-
yond the Grata, it continued to skirt the River bank as far as
the Barton now extends, and then made an angle, to the South
West. Near the Bridge, and on the West of the town, all un-
doubted traces of the boundary have disappeared. It is almost
certain, that its site is, for the most part, now included within
the gardens that stretch out to a considerable length behind
the houses on that side of West Street: and thus, every sign of
prior occupation of the soil has been gradually, but effectually
obliterated by the constant action of the Spade. A remnant of
an earth work which must have run nearly parallel with the
Town Wall, but outside‚ may still be seen in Great Yard, near
the Farm buildings; having a sharply defined outline, with a
steep descent into the trench. This may be a relic of the
“ bastions and modern fortifications of the time of King Charles
Ι,” observed by Dr. Stukeley “in the northern angle, beyond
the old ditch of the city, towards the River.”

In the Manuscripts, mention is made of two Gates. 1. The

ὓ Here, between the River and the Bridge, Dr. Stukeley found the
“track of the Roman wall.'’
