³¹* Edward 11. began to reign July 8. 1307; and his reign terminated
with his abdieation, or more eorrectly, deposition. This event occurred on
the 20th of January, 1327; and his son, Edward ΙΙΙ, was proelaimed King
on January 24th. So that at the time of his deposition‚ the King had only
reigned nineteen years and just over six months. In the same year, 1327,
on the 2lst of September, Edward the Second was murdered in Berkeley
Castle. 'l‘he regnal date given here, and repeated in the next Deed, must
eonsequently be an error There are likewise several grammatical inaccuracies
in both of these MSS. shewing the writer to have been ignorant or careless.
