note the kind of trade carried on there. The business, what-
ever its nature, was no doubt important and thriving3 and in
some of the Deeds the name of the place, after the manner of
the time, was frequently substituted for the surname of the
occupier. Thus, John Brice de Yerde, is commonly described
as John atte Yerde‚ or John Yerde. The special business of
the tenant, was most probably combined with Farming3 to

counties, from twenty acres or less, to forty acres,

grounds, possibly the abode of Hugh de Venele in the reign
of Henry the Third. Several centuries later, a large Mansion
was erected on the spot by one of the Lockyers’, then become
the wealthiest and most influential family in Ivelchester. A
portion of this edifice, comprising the two Eastern gables‚
was taken down many years ago: the remainder was converted
into the Manor Farm House. Crossing Venella, the
next object of interest was the Almshouse, founded by Robert
