doubt continuing its course parallel with the opposite mound
in Heave Acre3 with which it was probably connected, by a
traverse across the road at right angles, The road here,
it may be observed is hollow, being several feet lower than the
platforms on either side, What may have been the origin, or
the intention of these works‚ are questions not easy to be
decided. They might possibly be relies of the Roman oc-
cupation: or they may have formed part of the double fortifi-
cations by which Ilchester was defended, previously to the
Norman Conquest; as related by Camden. It is strange that
Stukeley should not have detected and examined these re-
markable elevations, His own quaint confession of the brief
hours he devoted to the investigation of old Ischalis and its
antiquities, may indeed amply account for the oversight.
“ These, he observes, were all the remarkables Ι met with at
Ischalis, where I stayed but half a day.

A “they say'' repeated by him, suggests a further question.
Can these mounds be the foundations of buildings once con-
stituting the “suburbs”3 “They say here, that the suburbs
extended SouthwardS, especially on the Yeovil Road, which
formerly had a Gate.” An assignment of these quadrilateral
platforms to such traditional “suburbs‚’' is however, open to
reasonable objection. The site of a ruined Street or Village,
usually presents a surface irregular and uneven. Here on the
contrary, exist levelness, regularity, and every indication of an
uniform plan. The Mounds on beth sides of the road appear
to have been systematically constructed, and carefully inter-
sected by a regular trench. Such indications lead to the more
probable opinion, that the ground in these parts was originally
raised for some military purpose3 if not by the Romans, at a
subsequent period, by our own countrymen in turbulent times.
2. In a field called Great Yard, at the opposite quarter of the
Town‚ North West‚ and bordered by the Ivel, are visible other
extensive vestiges of Earthworks‚ or foundations.
