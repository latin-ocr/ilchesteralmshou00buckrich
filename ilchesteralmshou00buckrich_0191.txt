and turned into a Free Grammar School. Leland gives no
clue to guide his readers with respect to the situation of this
Gate3 but leaves them in doubt, whether it might be one of
the four Wall Gates‚ or some arched and vaulted building
more centrally placed within the town.
4. St John, Neither does the name of this Church
occur in the Deeds. But it is well known that the advowson
of St J ohn's at Ivelcester‚ was in the patronage of the Abbots
of Muchelney. The following entry appears in the Taxatio of
Pope Nicholas IV. A.D. 1291. ‘⁶ Decanatus Ivelcestr:
Ivelcestr.’ P’och’ S’ci J oh'is.” Deanery of Ivelcester. Ivel-
cester, Parish of St J ohn.'' (Hugo. Much. Abb.) It is not re-
corded in what part of the Town this Church was placed.
5. St Peter. No express mention is made of the
Church of St Peter. But one of the Deeds points out indirectly,
though with a considerable degree of certainty, the former
situation of this Church. It refers to the Cross of St Peter.

the Cross here designated, near which lay this piece of ground
“ beneath the Wa11s‚” must consequently have stood near the
Wall Gate, either on the right or the left hand side of Chep-
strete. The Church and the Cross would be close together,
or at no great distance from each other. It may therefore be

of the Church of St Peter, if it lay on the West side of the
street, was at the end of the present Rectory Garden ; if it lay
to the East‚ was in the Orchard on the opposite side of the
road.

It appears then that there is proof more or less complete,
of the existence of all the Five Churches the names of which
