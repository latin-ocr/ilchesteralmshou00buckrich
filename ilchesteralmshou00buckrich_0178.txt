Veel in 1426—a building we may imagine to have been con-
structed in the substantial and picturesque style of the
Architecture of that period. Nearer to the Market Place was
another handsome Mansion, in which the Lion-hearted king,
as tradition reports‚ once held his Court‚ during a Royal
Progress through the Western Counties. In reality, perhaps,
this house belonged to the old family of the Cordelyons', who
died out in the last centuryf'ss A curious fragment of this
building, forming part of the stables of the Dolphin Inn, was
destroyed by fire about twenty years ago.

Facing the Market Place the Ancient Guildhall would form a
conspicuous and attractive object. This old building gave
way to the Sessions House of later times3 which in its turn,
has long been superseded by the modern plain and unpretend-
ing Town Hall. The Public Shambles‚ which, in 1428, were
placed in the vicinity of the Cross, made up the groupiug of
the Market Place. The positions of two of the
Churches of Ivelcester are as yet unaccounted for. In the
absence of proof to the contrary, there is room for reasonable
conjecture, that these sacred edifices, dedicated one to St.
Michael the Archangel, the other to St John the Evangelist,†
adorned and added interest to this Street—the principal
thoroughfare of the then County Town. On the whole
then, it may be fairly presumed‚ that West Street‚ the ancient
High Street of Ivelcester, in the days of the Edwards and
Henries, would offer to the eye of the spectator a highly
picturesque and attractive view as he entered the old Town by
it's North or it’s West Gate.
