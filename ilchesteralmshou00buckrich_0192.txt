VII. Some particulars relating to the REc'roRY or 1L0HEs'r1m.
In two Deeds‚ dated in the first year of Edward the Second,
A.D. 1307. allusions are made to a glebe field in the Manor
of Soke Deneys‚ belonging to the Rector of Ilchester: “a
meadow belonging to the Rector of the same ville on the
East.” And again—“ between a field of the Parson on the
East.” (See Deeds 15, 16) This glebe has been long severed
from the Rectory. lt was most likely commuted ages ago, for
the small yearly money-payment now payable to the Incum-
bents of Ilchester out of the Manor of Sock Dennis.

Extract from the Parish Register, relating to the Ilchester
Glebe situate at Urgesay, in the Parish of West Camel.
‘⁶ 1725, This year was finished the purchase of the Estate at
Urgesay bought as an Augmentation to this Rectory of
Ivelchester by the charitable munificence of the Lady Moyer
of the City of London & ye Bounty of Queen Anne of blessed
& glorious memory—Each>contributing 2200. George Hooper
Bishop of the Diocess. Rid Harris Reot.”

So recently as the year 1840, the old Rectory House
stood within the Churchyard‚ and so close to the Tower at its
North angle, as to leave only a narrow passage for access to
the North side of the Church. In that year the Burial
ground was considerably enlarged, the unsightly and obstruc-
tive glebe-house was taken down, and the ground on which it
stood was included in the Churchyard.
