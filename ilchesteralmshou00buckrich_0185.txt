This John White appears to have been the owner of various
messuages and tenements in the town. To another deed of
about the same time, he was an attesting witness, On these
two occasions only, does the name of Albe, or white, appear.
He may possibly have been the last surviving male of his race3
and in default of male issue, or (agreeably to the prevalent
notion of the age) for his soul's weffare, may have bequeathed
his house of residence and other property in Ivelcester‚ to the
Church, for religious uses. For in another record, dated 1304,
the first mention occurs in these deeds of a Religious House,
or Nunnery, called Albe Aule, White Hall. And in Subsequent
agreements the Prioress of this Conventual House is frequently
alluded to--1346 to 1429. Once she is designated Prioress of
Nywehalle‚ New Hall; perhaps from the circumstance of her
Convent having been recently enlarged or rebuilt. The Con-
vent or Nunnery of Whitehall, occupied a narrow belt of
ground extending from the River‚ parallel with the Road, as
far as the present Farm House, formerly the well known
Castle Inn. It's precincts must have been confined‚ and
hemmed in on the North and West sides by the Town Wall⁴
The front of the building was towards Chepstrete, facing the
Church of St Mary the Less, on the opposite side of the street.
When Dr. Stukeley wrote, in the first quarter of the last
century, there no doubt remained some portion of the old Con-
vent building3 for little more than a century earlier, in 1604, a
tenement is described as “belonging to Whitehall.’' In his
Plan of Ivelchester, is depicted a house of some kind, standing
on the angle of ground projecting towards the River (now used
as a Rick Barton) which he miscalls Whitechapel. The genuine
name Whitekall, however, has been faithfully handed down by
tradition to this day3 and is still familiar to the memory of
many aged persons in the Parish. ¹*
