level of the ground. These works, as they now appear, may
be generally described as two rect-angular platforms3 following
nearly the same straight line from North to South3 of nearly
equal height3 aud sloping down on their West and South sides
into a shallow ditch, partially filled up in the lapse of ages. The
first of these platforms commenced originally, I should sup-
pose, at the Moat ofthe Town Wall. Now, it may be said to
begin from the Cow Stalls just within the field3 any traces bc-
yond‚ being covered by these buildings. It is elevated some
three feet or more, above . the lower level of the land around,
The height of the second platform is rather less. To the West.
they face the meadows3 the Road forms their boundary on the
East. The breadth of the two is almost equa13 and a ditch
running East and West divides the one from the others*
From the buildings before mentioned to the opposite corner of
the first platform‚ Southward, the distance is about one hun-
dred and twenty five ya1·ds; its average width from West to
East, about fifty yards,

The length of the second platffirm, in a continued Southerly
direction, is fifty five yardS, or thereabouts3 its width to the
road, from fifty to sixty. The Field is called “ Heave Acre,”
with a reference doubtless to this peculia'r upheaval of the soil
in its North East quarter.

In the field called Prince's Pastum, on the opposite side of
the road, there are two other quadrangular platforms corres-
ponding with the two already described ; but of some what in-
ferior elevation. The North platform extends towards the
town, sixty two yards to the brook; and is in breadth fifty
four. The South mound‚ after a progress of sixty or seventy
yards Southward‚ grows less distinct3 though formerly, no

intersecting ditches between the platforms‚ on both sides of the mad—ignorant

perhaps, that he was defacing a work which had survived the injuries of Time
{or more than a thousand years.
